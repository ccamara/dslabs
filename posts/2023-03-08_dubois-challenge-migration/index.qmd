### W.E.B. Dubois

Explain who he was

## Recreating the plate

This

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(showtext) # Custom fonts
library(sf) # SF requires GDAL to be installed. Read packages' info with instructions.
library(spData) # Provides several geospatial datasets, such as the USA.


df_birthplace <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/master/plate08/birthplace.csv")

df_current <- read.csv("https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/raw/master/plate08/present.csv")

df <- df_current |> 
  left_join(df_birthplace, by = join_by(State))

```

## Extending the original

One of the aims of the challenge is to recreate Dubois plates using modern tools, in this years, not only new tools have appeared, there are also different visualisation types.
