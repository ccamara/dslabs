## The #DuboisChallenge

Read here https://nightingaledvs.com/the-dubois-challenge/

In this case, this is the image we want to recreate

You can read more here [@tackett2023]

![*"The Georgia Negro. A Social Study by W.E.Burghardt Du Bois".* The original image from Dubois that is to be recreated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/master/challenge/challenge09/original-plate-08.jpg){#fig-original}

### W.E.B. Dubois

Explain who he was

## Recreating the plate

This

```{r setup}
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-dubois-dataset
#| tbl-cap: WEB Dubois' data, combined in a single dataframe.

library(dplyr)
library(showtext) # Custom fonts
library(sf) # SF requires GDAL to be installed. Read packages' info with instructions.

df_birthplace <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/master/plate08/birthplace.csv")

df_current <- read.csv("https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/raw/master/plate08/present.csv")

dubois_df <- df_current |> 
  left_join(df_birthplace, by = join_by(State)) |> 
  rename_with(tolower)

# Explore the data
dubois_df |> 
  head() |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

Excellent! But regretfully, this is not all the data that we need. We need another dataset with the

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(spData) # Provides several geospatial datasets, such as the USA.

data("us_states")

head(us_states)
```

This provides us with interesting information and beteersweet news: The good news is that there's a column named `geometry` that means that the `us_states` object, is not a regular data frame, but is actually a spatial object:

```{r}
class(us_states)
```

We can view its geometry calling the `plot()` function from base R

```{r}
#| label: fig-us_data
#| fig-cap: US data (without Alaska) provided by `spData` package.

plot(us_states)

```

This is useful because we could combine (join) that geometry with the data in `dubois_df`. However, here come the bad news: in order to do that, we'd need a shared variable, and there is none. While both datasets refer to the same states, `dubois_df` uses their code names, whereas `us_states` has their full names.

We can overcome that with relative ease by combining a dataset that translates code names into full names:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-us-states-dictionary
#| tbl-cap: An intermediate dataset containing USA states' names and codes.

# Data from: https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/state-abbreviations
states_dic <- read.csv("data/us_states_names.csv")

states_dic |> 
  head() |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

Now we can combine everything together:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-dubois-data-with-states
#| tbl-cap: Dubois' data, now with the states' full name.

dubois_df <- dubois_df |> 
  rename(code = state) |> 
  left_join(states_dic, by = join_by(code))

dubois_df |> 
  head() |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

And we can join the data with the corresponding geometry:

```{r}

dubois_sdf <- us_states |> 
  left_join(dubois_df, by = c("NAME" = "state"))

dubois_sdf
```

https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master

Create a map

```{r}
library(tmap)

# df_long <- dubois_sdf |> 
#   select(GEOID, NAME, present.location, birthplace) |> 
#   tidyr::pivot_longer()

tm_shape(dubois_sdf) +
    tm_polygons("birthplace")

```

REad https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49423007/how-to-adjust-color-palette-with-customized-breaks-in-tmap

```{r}

library(usmap)

plot_usmap(data = dubois_df, values = "birthplace")

```

## Extending the original

One of the aims of the challenge is to recreate Dubois plates using modern tools, in this years, not only new tools have appeared, there are also different visualisation types.
