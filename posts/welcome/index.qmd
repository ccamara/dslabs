This is just a placeholder post that I will update at some point to explain what this site is, what motivated to create it and probably other stuff such about how did I create it (spoiler alert: quarto) or who I am.

I just created this experimental site to experiment with computational notebooks and share code and text with others, but also with myself.

Often times, I found myself wanting to do something I knew I did in the past, or trying to reproduce some code I've seen elsewhere, but I do not know where to find it. This site will address that.
