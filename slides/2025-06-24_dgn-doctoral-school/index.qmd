# Outline

-   13.30-14.30: Talk
-   14.30-15.00: Break
-   15.00-16.00: Hands-on: Create your own visualisation

# Setting the expectations

![](assets/data-visualization-training-Google-Search.png)

# Disclaimer

-   This is not a course on how to do (good) data visualisations (there are entire degrees for that!)
-   Impossible to provide a training on data vis in 1h.
    -   Plenty of training and videos that promise tools or tricks about data vis

## The usual approach

-   Tools

-   Recipes / Tricks

-   Chart types

![Source](assets/Chart-Infographic.jpg)

# Aims

Hopefully I will deconstruct the way they understand data vis, and leave them at the start point, but with a refreshed undersanding of what they are, and wehere to get started.

-   Critically understand how can we use data visualisations in research

-   No solutions

-   More questions than answers

-   But..

    -   You'll leave with key concepts to critically understand data visualisations and to get started in this exciting journey, and tools

# Question time! {background-image="assets/question-time.jpg" background-color="#000" background-opacity="50%"}

::: incremental
1.  Who has ever created a data visualisation?
2.  What did you intend to achieve when you created them?
3.  Did you succeed?

# Definition

## What are data visualisations?

Is this a data vis?

-   Maps are a particular type of data visualisation: geospatial data visualisation.

    -   They encode geographic positions (at least!)

-   The tools used to create data visualisations are irrelevant (Babylon map)

## Definitions

> It is commonly stated that a picture tells a thousand words. As such, the visual register has long been used to summarise and describe datasets through statistical charts and graphs, diagrams,
> spatialisations, maps, and animations. **These visual methods effectively reveal and communicate the structure, pattern and trends of variables and their interconnections**. Given the enormous volumes and velocity of big data, it is then no surprise that **visualisation has proven a popular way for making sense of data and communicating that sense**. [@kitchin2014, chap. 6 ]

> Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively. [@munzner2015, p. 1]

---

> Visualizations are often described by the constraints from which they were designed:
>
> -   resources needed (data, media...)
>
> -   task to be enabled (to locate, compare, reflect)
>
> -   the context of use (e.g. users, situation, device).

# A note on data

Data vis needs data. Different types of data

![@munzner2015](assets/Munzner-2015-fig2.1.png)

# Uses

## Communicating information

Communication findings

Usually come at the end of the process.

Data vis are good to communicate findings because

Importance here is:

-   Audience

-   "Activation": titles, labels, fonts... messages... anything we neeed to make sure that the message we want to convey is understood.

-   aesthetics...

-   Make data vis memorable

## Data exploration and data analysis

This comes at early stages of the research process.

Here, we want data vis to be quick (compare the code here, from the code from the previous plot)
