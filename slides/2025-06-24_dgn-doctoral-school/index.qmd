    Hello, my name is Carlos Cámara and I am a Senior Research Software Engineer at CIM.
    
    With this cryptic title I intend to get you started in something I am passionate for: data visualisations. And also, dinosaurs.

Thanks to their authors: Greg McInerny, Cagatay Turkay, Timothy Monteath

Thanks to all those involved: Timothy Monteath, Selene Yang, Silvia Ribera Alfaro, Alejandra Canclini.

-   This is not a course on how to do (good) data visualisations (there are entire degrees for that!)

-   Impossible to provide a training on data vis in 2h.

    -   Plenty of training and videos that promise tools or tricks about data vis

-   **Tools:** Tableau, Power BI, Javascript libraries, Observable, Python, R...

### Yes

They all are important stuff:

-   **Tools** define what we can and can't do, and how we do it (consider affordances, workflows, price, features...)

-   Choosing the right **Chart types** is not trivial, and play a key role in succeeding or failing at what we want to do with data vis.

-   **Recipes / Tricks** are ideal to quickly learn specific, frequent tasks.

### ...But

-   They are usually subject to trends or commercial interests (Newer != better)

    -   New chart types and software are constantly created (also, see @wickham2010)

-   Too specific, difficult to generalise from or start from

-   Data visualisations are way [more than a series of technical choices]{.highlight-text}.

-   We may have an understanding of what Data Visualisations are, but defining them is not always easy.

-   What defines a data visualisation are not **types** (scatterplots, pie, bars...)

    -   Actually, we've seen visualisations that do not fit in a particular type of chart (see Grammar of Graphics [@wickham2010] )

-   ...nor the **tools** used to generate them (e.g. Babylon map)

-   ...nor their **visual qualities** or **complexity** (e.g. scatterplot)

-   ... or their **accuracy**, even!

-   They all have something in common... **data**!

    -   **Mapping data** to specific features (colours, shapes, position...)

# Definitions

> It is commonly stated that a picture tells a thousand words. As such, the visual register has long been used to summarise and describe datasets through statistical charts and graphs, diagrams, spatialisations, maps, and animations. **These visual methods effectively reveal and [communicate the structure, pattern and trends of variables and their interconnections]{.highlight-text}**. Given the enormous volumes and velocity of big data, it is then no surprise that **visualisation has proven a popular way for making sense of data and communicating that sense**.

## Example {.smaller}

Consider this dataset containing three columns and `r nrow(datasaurus)` rows:

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Table showing random 15 rows of our dataset to have a sense of our data.
#| label: fig-datasaurus

datasaurus <- datasaurus |> 
  mutate(
    category = as.factor(dataset),
    category = fct_relevel(category,  "away", "wide_lines", "dots", "v_lines", "h_lines", "high_lines", "slant_down", "slant_up", "circle", "bullseye",  "star", "x_shape", "dino"),
    category = as.factor(as.integer(category))
  ) |> 
  as_tibble()

datasaurus |> 
  select(category, x, y) |> 
  slice_sample(n = 15) |> 
  kable()

```

##  {.smaller data-menu-title="Summary statistics"}

We see we have a column called `category`, so we can get a summary statistics of the `x` and `y` for each category:

```{r}
datasaurus |> 
  group_by(category) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_x = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_x = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_x = min(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_x = max(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_y = mean(y, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_y = sd(y, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_y = min(y, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_y = max(y, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

It is difficult to see any pattern (groups have almost identical means and standard deviations). Could data visualisations be more useful?

##  {.smaller data-menu-title="Visual summary statistics"}

We can create a scatterplot and assign a colour per each category:

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(datasaurus, aes(x = x, y = y, color = category)) +
  geom_point()
```

Still not very useful unless you have extraordinary sight for pattern recognition. Let's try something different: let's create small multiples per category (i.e., an array of independent plots for each category)

##  {.smaller data-menu-title="Visual summary statistics (cont)"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(datasaurus, aes(x = x, y = y, color = category)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~category)
```

This famous dataset is called [`datasaurus dozen`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datasaurus_dozen) and was constructed in 2016 by [Alberto Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Cairo) for illustrative purposes (see @matejka2017)

## Correlations

## Clustering / dimension reduction

## Summary

Here the importance lies more on Speed than aesthetics:

-   They are part of a process: they need to be easy to generate and adapt

    -   Usually hand-in-hand with data manipulation

    -   Integrated in the research workflow

    -   Importance of programming languages (R, Python) or Visual Programming Languages (Orange)

-   They need to be understandable by the researcher/research team/reviewers

    -   labels, titles... are less important here

    -   academic audience only -\> scientific types (e.g., boxplots...) are welcome

# Conclusions {background-color="rgba(108,183,255,0.4)"}

After deconstructing how we understand data vis, it may seem we are agin at the start point, but we have acquired a refreshed undersanding about:

-   What data visualisations are and how are can be used (in research)
    -   They can be way more than mere communicative artifacts that come at the end of the process
-   Some criteria and key concepts to consider when creating good<sup>\*</sup> data visualisations

Also:

-   You've learnt about useful tools and resources to get started with!

You're now equipped with the basics to get started this amazing path! (if you want to)

<sup>\*</sup> Good as in "successfully achieving their goal", not as in an aesthetical sense.
