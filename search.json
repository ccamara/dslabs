    "text": "The iconic film series “The Matrix” (and sequels) can be recognized by a number of technical and aesthetical features, but probably, the most unique one is their green cascading code1 that is present throughout the films and also its promotional imagery and fanart.\nIt is no wonder, then, that the Internet is flooded by a number of tutorials or even web tools aimed at reproducing those aesthetics. However, all of them require Image Editing software such as Photoshop, like this excellent tutorial from Abbey Esparza which was an inspiration for me.\nIn this case, however, I will not be using any editing software. Instead, I will be solely using code to produce a Matrix-like image like the one below (Figure 2), and some bonus output, too. Specifically, I’m going to use R and {magick} (Ooms 2023), which is an R interface for Imagemagik developed by the rOpensCi community."

    "text": "Why would we want to do this using R?\nBefore starting with the tutorial, though, I need to be crystal clear. I do not think that R and any of their image-manipulation packages or, more generally, a programming language, can fully replace an image editing software such as Photoshop or GIMP2. After all, they are made for different purposes and with different audiences in mind.\n2 GIMP is an excellent Free/Libre OpenSource software for image manipulation, very similar (feature-wise) to Photoshop. You can visit the official website https://gimp.org\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that using R for handling images doesn’t make sense at all. On the contrary! There are a number of cases where manipulating images from code makes a lot of sense:\n\nBatch manipulation\nImage transformation based on some kind of data (either metadata or linked data)\nIncluding images as part of our data visualisation workflow/outputs\n…\n\nTherefore, this tutorial is a proof of concept and a demonstration about how can R be used for creative tasks and manipulation. It is also an exploration of the limits3.\n3 Given my background as an architect, I’ve used Photoshop and GIMP extensively in the past, with a great deal of success. However, as someone who is interested in coding, I could see how destructive and non-reproducible the workflows can be. So, this is also a selfish exercise where I wanted to see how far I could go using R in a creative context and understanding their limits."

But because I was also aware that this is a well-known topic within the field, which has received quite a lot of attention, I wanted to find a different image to those illustrating the blog posts accompanying an explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Graphical explanation of the Datasaurus Dozen by their authors (Matejka & Fitzmaurice)\n\n\n\nSo when reflecting on how to represent a dinosaur hidden in data, or images appearing out of a messy dataset, I suddenly remembered the Matrix scene where Neo learns how the Matrix works and how, immediately, what used to be inscrutable code turns into recognizable images.\nI was immediately seduced by the idea of creating a Dinosaur (ideally similar to that in the datasaurus) emerging from what could be a Matrix-like dataset, and using data visualisation tools for that seemed the most logic (and most meta) thing to do. The text describing that (with a pun) just emphasizes that idea."

    "text": "Step by step\nI started the process with the following outline in mind:\n\nwe need to combine a background image and a dinosaur (ideally with little or no colors)\nwe need to add some effects to the dinosaur\nwe need to add some text to it\n\nAs you will see, it turned out to be more complex (I needed to create more intermediate steps), but the essence is the same. The GIF4 below is probably the best description of what we are going to do.\n4 This GIF has also been generated with R, refer to Section 3.11 for details.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Graphic overview of what we will be doing in this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\nLoading dependencies\nin this case, we will only be using a single library: {magick}, developed by Jeroen Ooms. According to its website, [Magick provides]:\n\nBindings to ImageMagick: the most comprehensive open-source image processing library available. Supports many common formats (png, jpeg, tiff, pdf, etc) and manipulations (rotate, scale, crop, trim, flip, blur, etc). All operations are vectorized via the Magick++ STL meaning they operate either on a single frame or a series of frames for working with layers, collages, or animation. In RStudio images are automatically previewed when printed to the console, resulting in an interactive editing environment.\n\nSo the only thing we need to do is installing the package normally and then adding a call to library() at the beginning of our document:\n\nlibrary(magick)\n\nLinking to ImageMagick 6.9.12.3\nEnabled features: cairo, fontconfig, freetype, heic, lcms, pango, raw, rsvg, webp\nDisabled features: fftw, ghostscript, x11\n\n# Also save some variables.\ncol_matrix &lt;- \"#00dc00\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that because magick is just an interface, we need to have ImageMagick library installed in our system if it’s not already installed (i.e., in Linux Machines). magick’s Readme file covers that https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/articles/intro.html#installing-magick\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad images\nOnly two images are needed for this tutorial: a background image and a dinousaur with a transparent background5. I downloaded the T-Rex image from Unsplash (thanks to the author, Amy-Leigh Barnard, for releasing it under the Unsplash License), and I fond the matrix-like background using DuckDuckGo’s search for Images under Creative Commons, which pointed me towards Peter DeHaas’ website.\n5 Actually, the dinousar image is the only image I failed to generate using R. I used GIMP to create an alpha channel and remove the background from the original Photo by Amy-Leigh Barnard on Unsplash:\n\nYou can read a tutorial on how to do that using GIMP here: https://www.guidingtech.com/remove-background-gimp-layer-mask/So, once we get the images stored in a folder within our project, we need to load them to R’s environment:\n\n# Load images\ndino &lt;- image_read(\"img/amy-leigh-barnard-SByb8Ch9XcQ-unsplash.png\") \nmatrix_bg &lt;- image_read(\"img/matrix01.webp\") \n\n# Put them together in a vector\nimages_clips &lt;- c(dino, matrix_bg)\n\n# Display the images side by side\nimage_append(image_scale(images_clips, \"x200\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Display images' properties\nprint(images_clips)\n\n  format width height colorspace matte filesize density\n1    PNG  4608   3072       sRGB  TRUE  8293810   72x72\n2   WEBP  2000   1000       sRGB FALSE   373842   72x72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the different output from calling the images directly or using print(): the first one displays the image, whereas the later will show the image’s properties as well as the image. There are two things that it’s worth paying attention to judging from the images’ properties:\n\nThey have different sizes. This would be an issue when combining images, so we need to scale them to similar sizes before doing that.\nDinousaur is stored in a PNG format. These type of formats are usually used because they have an alpha channel (in this case, a transparent background), which is extremely useful for our purposes.\n\n\n\nScaling images\nDue to the dinosaur being considerable larger than the background, we need to resize the image before combining them. There are a number of ways to alter the size of an image (with or without distortions)6, but we will be using image_scale():\n6 For an explanation of the available options, refer to https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/reference/transform.html\n# Remove the extra background.\ndino &lt;- image_trim(dino) \n\n# Scale proportionally to a height of 800px.\ndino &lt;- image_scale(dino, \"x800\")\n\n\n\nCombining images (first attempt)\nBecause the dinosaur doesn’t have any background, we can combine them by overlying it on top of the background using image_composite():\n\nimage_composite(matrix_bg, dino)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: First attempt at compositing two images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder matters!\n\n\n\n\n\nPay attention to the order of the images, as it does matter! The first one will be placed on top of the second.\n\nimage_composite(dino, matrix_bg) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Resuling image with wrong order: the background is completely covering the dinousaur\n\n\n\n\n\nActually, this output is very similar to something we will want to achieve at a latter point.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, by default composite image gets the size of the first image and adds a second one aligned from its top left position. Because both images have different sizes, the dinosaur seems to be floating. We can control the alignment using the gravity pattern, which accepts several strings7.\n7 For the full list of accepted strings refer to this page at ImageMagick’s documentation https://www.imagemagick.org/Magick++/Enumerations.html#GravityType\n# We can use gravity to control alignment\nimage_composite(matrix_bg, dino, gravity = \"SouthEast\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Controlling images alignment with gravity parameter\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s slightly better, but the dinosaur stands out too much, and it is clear that there are two juxtaposed images that have nothing to do one with each other. We will try to address that by:\n\nDessaturating / coloring it\nAdding the code on top of it\n\n\n\nColor dessaturation\nOne of the outstanding features of The Matrix imagery is by the absence of colors except for green and black. This effect has been accentuated over time (see Figure 8 ), and has often implied using dessaturated images (the clearer examples are Figure 8 (c) and Figure 8 (d)). We are going to try to achieve that with our dinosaur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The Matrix (1999)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The Matrix Reloaded (2003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) The Matrix Revolutions (2003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) 20th Anniversary poster (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) The Matrix Ressurrections (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Evolution of The Matrix series’ graphic image through its posters (1999) © Warner Bros. Entertainment\n\n\n\nThe most immediate way to remove the colours from an image is to convert it to a grayscale image:\n\n# Convert to grayscale\ndino_grey &lt;- image_quantize(dino, colorspace = 'gray')\n\ndino_grey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDessaturation\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative that gives more control is to change saturation. Moving the saturation somewhere between 100 (maximum value: all colors) and 1 (minimum value: grayscale) gives more control and interesting results.\n\n# Or better, partially dessaturate the image\ndino_grey2 &lt;- image_modulate(dino, saturation = 20)\ndino_grey2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage_modulate(dino, saturation = 20, brightness = 200)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis result is probably more similar to Figure 8 (d)\n\n\n\n\n# We can use gravity to control alignment\nimage_composite(matrix_bg, dino_grey, gravity = \"SouthEast\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Composition with greyscale dino\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is getting better, but probably, it would be even better if the dinosaur was greener (something similar to Figure 8 (c) . One way to do that could be by colorizing the image:\n\n# We can use image colorize with low opacity values\ndino_green &lt;- image_colorize(dino_grey2, opacity = 40, color =  \"#379b47\")\ndino_green\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Colorized image, with low opacity\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see how it looks when combined with our background.\n\nimage_composite(matrix_bg, dino_green, gravity = \"SouthEast\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Composition with coloured dino\n\n\n\n\n\nRegretfully, this doesn’t look particularly good: the dinosaur’s details seemed veiled (actually, that’s what we did: we covered the dinosaur with a thin, green veil).\nWe are going to use a slightly different approach now. This time we will be combining a greyscale version with a green image, but using multiply as the blend mode. Multiply will keep the same details of the original image, but will result in a darker image (which in this case, is also desired!)8 . Also, because we do not have a green image, we will need to create one from scratch using image_blank():\n8 For more information about multiply blend mode, refer to this tutorial https://digital-photography-school.com/multiply-blend-mode/ . Also, the wikipedia has information about different blend modes, including, but not limited to, multiply: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes\n# We need to create an image of the same size with just colour green.\ngreen_img &lt;-  image_blank(2000, 1000, color = col_matrix)\n\n# Combine two images using Multiply blend mode.\ndino_green2 &lt;- image_composite(dino_grey2, green_img, operator = \"Multiply\")\n\ndino_green2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Multiply produces a sharper green dino, but transparency is lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this dinosaur is darker and their details (shades) don’t look so washed away as the previous one (Figure 10). Regretfully, the colour is also added to the background, which used to be transparent, so we will need to restore the alpha channel. We will do that by creating yet another composite, but using copyopacity operator this time to copy the alpha channel from the original dinosaur.\n\n# Restoring alpha channel.\ndino_green2 &lt;- image_composite(dino_green2, dino, operator = 'copyopacity')\n\n# Compare results\nimage_append(image_scale(c(dino_green, dino_green2), \"x250\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Green dinos’ comparison: colorised (left) and mulitplied (right)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, we can combine the green dinosaur with the background:\n\nimage_composite(matrix_bg, dino_green2, gravity = \"SouthEast\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Composition with coloured dino (multiply version)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding code texture to the dinosaur\nBecause we wanted to recreate the effect on Figure 1 (b) that suggests that the dinosaur is also made of code, we will need to over impress the source code over the T-Rex. To do that, we could apply the same technique we used for Figure 13 and merge the background with the dinosaur using the copyopacity operator.\n\ndino_matrix &lt;- image_composite(matrix_bg, dino_green2, operator = 'copyopacity', \n                               gravity = \"SouthEast\")\n\ndino_matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Matrix code within the dinosaur silhouette.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost there! We have the code applied to the dinosaur, but the texture and details have been lost, only its silhouette has been preserved! We will combine two images, but using the dissolve blend mode:\n\ndino_matrix &lt;- image_composite(dino_matrix, dino_green2, compose_args = \"60%\", \n                               operator = \"dissolve\", gravity = \"SouthEast\")\n\ndino_matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: A green dinosaur with the Matrix code and its texture applied.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks nice9, so now we can combine that with the background:\n9 Probably, the dinosaur is too green now. If that’s the case, we could try to overlay the code on top of the grey dinosaur or the slightly dessaturated version, instead of the green T-Rex. However, for the sake of better illustrating the next step, I will be using this version.\nimage_composite(matrix_bg, dino_matrix, gravity = \"SouthEast\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Composition with the dino with code. Not nice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting image is way less impressive that what he had imagined, right? Why isn’t it looking as good as the previous compositions if the dinosaur with the code looked even better than the previous ones? Basically, the problem is that because we have used the same image for the background and as a texture over the dinosaur, the background and foreground are matching and it seems we just added it on top of a green dinosaur, which is not what we wanted to achieve (it seems that there’s a dinosaur behind a curtain of raining letters).\nThere are different ways to overcome that issue:\n\nUse different (but similar) images for the background and the code texture (that would be ideal, but I didn’t have much time to find images, also, it will be good for teaching purposes)\nModify the background so it looks slightly different.\n\n\n\nModifying the background\nIn order to make the background look like a different image than the code from the foreground, we are going to do these two transformations:\n\nDisplace it\nBlur it\n\nBecause this is getting long, I’m becoming lazier, and in this case I will use the pipe operator to chain several transformations and I will also use image_flop() instead of moving the background using some of the image transformations provided by {magick}\n\nmatrix_bg2 &lt;- matrix_bg %&gt;% \n  image_flop() %&gt;% # This creates a vertical mirror, which is a lazy way to move the background\n  image_blur(10, 10) \n\nimage_composite(matrix_bg2, dino_matrix, gravity = \"SouthEast\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Composition with the dino with code, after altering the background\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see that dinosaur! However, I realised that in some recent posters, the images are not completely green, but have some greyish texture. We could try to do the same, but instead of having an entirely green dinosaur, using one of the grey versions with code overlayed on them.\n\ndino_matrix2 &lt;- image_composite(dino_matrix, dino_grey2, compose_args = \"40%\", \n                                operator = \"dissolve\", gravity = \"SouthEast\")\n\nimage_composite(matrix_bg2, dino_matrix2, gravity = \"SouthEast\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Same composition, but the dino is not completely green.\n\n\n\n\n\nWay better now! We can see that the dinosaur now stands out against the background, but we could do better: we could add a light green glow around the dinosaur, just like the original imagery does.\n\n\nGlow effect\nThis is probably one of the trickiest parts of this tutorial. Imagemagik (and therefore, {magick}) allow a limited range of effects (check all of them here), but none of them consists of projecting an inner or outer glow, which is what you’d do in Photoshop or GIMP. For a while I played with the idea of projecting an outer shadow using image_shadow() (but it would only project square shadows) or image_shadow_mask() but only seems to work for vector images.\nSo, instead, we will be achieving that in several steps:\n\nCreate a light green silhouette\nScale it to make it slightly bigger than the original, so it seems like a contour\nBlur the contour image\nAdd it below the dinosaur\n\n\n# Create a glow effect\ndino_glow_tmp1 &lt;- dino_green %&gt;% \n  image_colorize(color = \"#00dc00\", opacity = 100) %&gt;% \n  image_blur(200, sigma = 20)\n\n# We are ready to add the dino on top of it!\ndino_glow_tmp2 &lt;- dino_glow_tmp1 %&gt;% \n  image_composite(dino_grey2, gravity = \"southeast\") # Using grey version to highlight the effect.\n\n# Compare results\nimage_append(image_scale(c(dino_glow_tmp1, dino_glow_tmp2), \"x250\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Glowing silouetthe (left) and glowing dino (right). First attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure on the left shows a perfectly green T-Rex with blurry contour, so wen we overlay a dinosaur on top of it, it looks like if it was glowing. It looks pretty neat, right? Well… except that there is an issue. Look at the upper border and left side of the image: the glow looks trimmed! Actually, because the glow exceeds the size of the original image, the glow also exceeds the canvas and it is not shown on those areas.\nTo fix this we will need to make the canvas (not the image) a little bit bigger, making room for the glow to grow without being trimmed. We will do that using image_extent(), paying attention to make the canvas grow from the bottom right corner (because that’s the point we are using to align the dino within the background). Once we are done with that, we can then remove any extra white space using image_trim() and proceed to add the dinosaur with the code on top of it.\n\ndino_matrix_glow &lt;- dino_green %&gt;% \n  image_colorize(color = \"#00dc00\", opacity = 100) %&gt;% \n  image_extent(\"1200x900\", gravity = \"southeast\") %&gt;% # Increase the canvas' size.\n  image_blur(200, sigma = 20) %&gt;% \n  image_trim() %&gt;%  # Remove the extra canvas space\n  image_composite(image_trim(dino_matrix2), gravity = \"southeast\")\n\ndino_matrix_glow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Glowing T-Rex, now without trimmed glows.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is how the the final composition would look like when we add the glowing dinosaur to the background (compare it to Figure 19)\n\nimage_composite(matrix_bg2, dino_matrix_glow, gravity = \"SouthEast\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Adding the glowing dinosaur to the composition\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we are almost done, now! We could add some text on top of the image, and that would be it.\n\n\nAdding text\nAdding text over images is pretty straightforward using image_annotate(), but there are some considerations to be made for this particular case:\n\nWe have a dark image, so we will need to give the text a light color, as opposed to the default black color\nThe image is quite big, so we will have to either scale it down or use big fonts\n\n\nannotated_dino &lt;- image_composite(matrix_bg2, dino_matrix_glow, gravity = \"SouthEast\") %&gt;% \n  image_annotate(\n    text = \"This text is shown in the top left corner\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    size = 30\n  )\n\nannotated_dino\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Adding our first text.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the text is positioned on the top left corner of the image, but we can control that with the parameters gravity and location.\n\nannotated_dino2 &lt;- image_composite(matrix_bg2, dino_matrix_glow, gravity = \"SouthEast\") %&gt;% \n  image_annotate(\n    text = \"This text is shown in the top left corner (with padding)\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    size = 30,\n    location = \"+100+100\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  image_annotate(\n    text = \"This text is shown in the center, slightly rotated\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    size = 30,\n    gravity = \"center\",\n    degrees = 20\n  ) %&gt;% \n  image_annotate(\n    text = \"This text is shown in the bottom right\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    size = 30,\n    gravity = \"southeast\",\n    location = \"+100+100\"\n  )\n\nannotated_dino2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Combining several text strings and controlling their position\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the basics, but there are other interesting parameters we can use with image_annotate() to control the font family, text rotation, style, decoration, kerning… but I’m sure you get the idea.\nIn the example below, I’m using two custom font types that are Matrix-theme inspired and are also free to use:\n\nMiltown II by Apostrophic Labs\nWhite rabbit by Matthew Welch\n\n\nfinal_image &lt;- image_composite(matrix_bg2, dino_matrix_glow, gravity = \"SouthEast\")  %&gt;% \n  image_annotate(\n    text = \"Data visualisation use cases:\",\n    font = \"white rabbit\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    strokecolor = \"#A7F4A7\",\n    size = 30,\n    weight = 700,\n    location = \"+90+90\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  image_annotate(\n    text = \"#1: to find dinosaurs\", \n    font = \"miltown ii\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    strokecolor = \"#A7F4A7\",\n    size = 70, \n    weight = 700,\n    location =\"+90+120\") %&gt;% \n  image_annotate(\n    text = \"Data can contain hidden \\nand suprising patterns \\nthat only visualisations \\ncan reveal\",\n    font = \"white rabbit\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    strokecolor = \"#A7F4A7\",\n    size = 40,\n    location = \"+90+400\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  image_annotate(\n    text = \"Great examples of this are the Anscombe quartet \\nor the Datasaurus Dozen (Matejka & Fitzmaurice, 2017)\",\n    font = \"white rabbit\",\n    color = \"white\",\n     strokecolor = \"#A7F4A7\",\n    size = 28,\n    gravity = \"southwest\",\n    location = \"+90+90\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  image_annotate(\n    text = \"Source: datasaurus@pixelfed.social\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    gravity = \"southeast\",\n    location = \"+50+50\",\n    size = 18\n  )\n\nfinal_image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: The final image\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this is it!

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThroughout this post, we’ve learnt that we can use R (and coding) for creative purposes. There are several takeaways from this experience:\n\nManipulating images with R is relatively straightforward from a technical standpoint: it works pretty much in the same way you’d work with regular data (we can even use tidyverse’s pipe operators for that!). Proof is that creating that image would only require 69 lines of very readable code, as demonstrated in Section 3.10\nHowever, that doesn’t mean it’s easy or fast. Admittedly, I spent a lot of time doing this, way more than if I would have used GIMP instead. It’s true that I’m way more experienced using GIMP and it is my first experience using magick in R (not bad for a first timer!), so that shouldn’t be a surprise. Where I pent most time of was planning what I wanted to do, and repeating it by trial and error. Admittedly, this is true from every creative process and not very different from what would have happened with GIMP or Phosothop. However, not having a GUI makes you perform some extra steps. On the bright side, repeating the same tasks while changing some parameters is extremely fast and easy when you are coding.\nThere are some things where I feel I could have done better with GIMP, as I’d have full control over the image (i.e., by working with level curves, or applying some gradients in some areas), not to mention that there are way more effects I can apply.\nProbably the reasons for manipulating code are better summarised in the code used to generate Figure 27 : I really love the idea of having a creative process that can be entirely reproduced in a matter of seconds. And what is more, it is a non-destructive process which can also be easily tweaked (i.e. using a different image for the background, changing the text, changing the green colour…). This is particularly true if we were to repeat the process a number of times with minor tweaks or wanted to make sure of the process’ provenance, something where Image Editors fail at doing, and the only way to overcome that is to keep intermediate steps stored in their native file format. To make things worse those files are usually huge in terms of file size.\nStoring all the steps in code ensures the process’ provenance in a more efficient way: code is stored in text files which are very small in terms of file size and can be version controlled.\n\nSo, all in all, while not that popular, using coding for image manipulation makes a lot of sense in some cases like the ones outlined before, and it’s a practice I am willing to use more frequently."

So far, I have applied a spatial reading with a social perspective to the topic of urban, spatial inequities, and, more specifically, on urban mobility for disabled people and urban commons to find ways in which cities can be more resilient and egalitarian.\nWorking at CIM as Senior Research Software Engineer has given me the opportunity of bridging my passions by applying technology and software through an social perspective and within a collaborative setting to the existing diverse and interdisciplinar research culture and teaching of the Centre.\nAreas of Interest: Urban Studies, Open Science, Commons, Co-production, Data Visualisation, Spatial Justice"
