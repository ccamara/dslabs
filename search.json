It is in that field where I have extensive teaching experience as a Lecturer at the School of Architecture and Technology at Universidad San Jorge (Spain), Associate Lecturer at the MSc on Cities and Urbanism at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Spain), and Associate Lecturer at the School of the Built Environment at Oxford Brookes University, amongst others. As a researcher, I have worked as a Research Fellow at Warwick’s IGSD, studiying the role visual representations to understand and engage with abstract concepts like the Food-Energy-Water nexus; as a research associate at Urban Transformation and Global Change Laboratory (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya), exploring the geographies of digital capitalism and bottom-up alternatives through their research areas on urbanization processes and co-creation; and at the Open Source Architectures Research Group at Universidad San Jorge, contributing in the projects \"Zaragoza's Social Risk Map\" and \"Accessible Zaragoza\", as a PI."

    "text": "Research Profile\nThe combination of such diverse experiences, interests, and skills has articulated my research agenda within the Urban Studies, structured around two pillars: 1) the commodifications between cities, technology, and society, and 2) co-production and collective-action. So far, I have applied a spatial reading with a social perspective to the topic of urban, spatial inequities, and, more specifically, on urban mobility for disabled people and urban commons to find ways in which cities can be more resilient and egalitarian.\nWorking at CIM as Senior Research Software Engineer has given me the opportunity of bridging my passions by applying technology and software through an social perspective and within a collaborative setting to the existing diverse and interdisciplinar research culture and teaching of the Centre.\nAreas of Interest: Urban Studies, Open Science, Commons, Co-production, Data Visualisation, Spatial Justice"
